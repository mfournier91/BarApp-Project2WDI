## Project Workflow
Performing/Excelling - Great planning folder! Good solid user stories. Really like your readme. Great wireframes.

## Technical Requirements
Excelling- Wow! What an incredible project. Really great work. Your app has seven 7 models including many associations. You leveraged many to many associations, self referential joins and even customized your devise user model to boot.

## Code Quality
Performing - There are some indentation issues with your erb's but other other than code looks pretty well indented and there's good separation of concerns. The biggest piece of the pie missing though, is comments. Your codebase isn't commented at all! Future Mark will be much happier with past Mark if you comment your code.

## Creativity Interface
Performing - The site is really nicely styled. There are features though that aren't easily accessible. The first thing that comes to mind is messaging. It seems like messaging is only one-way currently. Additionally, there's not really an easy approach to get to where you can message someone. Also it's hard to get to a user's favorites as well. Barring that, looks great!
